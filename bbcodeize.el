;;; Commentary:

;; This package converts the buffer text and the associated
;; decorations to BBCODE.

;; To use it, just switch to the buffer you want BBCODE-ized and type
;; `M-x bbcodeize-buffer'.  You will be switched to a new buffer that
;; contains the resulting BBCODE.  You can edit and inspect this
;; buffer, or you can just save it with C-x C-w.  `M-x bbcodeize-file'
;; will find a file, fontify it, and save the BBCODE version in
;; FILE..bbcode.txt, without any additional intervention.  `M-x
;; bbcodeize-many-files' allows you to bbcodeize any number of files in
;; the same manner.  `M-x bbcodeize-many-files-dired' does the same for
;; files marked in a dired buffer.

  "Convert BUFFER to BBCODE, preserving colors and decorations.

The generated BBCODE is available in a new buffer, which is returned.
When invoked interactively, the new buffer is selected in the current
window.  The title of the generated document will be set to the buffer's
file name or, if that's not available, to the buffer's name.

Note that bbcodeize doesn't fontify your buffers, it only uses the
decorations that are already present.  If you don't set up font-lock or
something else to fontify your buffers, the resulting BBCODE will be
plain.  Likewise, if you don't like the choice of colors, fix the mode
that created them, or simply alter the faces it uses."
